# design a data structure

goal: design a data structure with the following operations:

insert(x, T) - insert x into set T
delete(k, T) - delete kth smallest element from T
member(x, T) - return true if x is element of T

all operations must maintain O(log n)

## solution

in order to maintian O(log n) time, the underlying data structure needs to be a balanced tree

for efficient deletion, we could maintain additional pointers for the successor and predecessor at each node

while walking the tree when inserting, we could check if the current node value is greater than or less than the current value and we could set successor or predecessor based on that

aside from that, we could check if the current node value is greater than or less than the existing successor or predecessor and update accordingly

when deleting a node, we'd need to rebalance the tree

we'd also need to update the pointers on the parent and children, as well as any successor or predecessor pointers currently pointing to the node to be deleted
