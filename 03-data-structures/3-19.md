# constant successor and predecessor

goal: modify a balanced data structure so that search, insert, delete, predecessor, and successor still take up O(log n) while maximum and minimum take up O(1)

## solution

maintain two additional variables for the min and the max

- insert - on insert, we check if the value to be inserted is less than or greater than the min or the max and update accordingly
- delete - on delete, if the value of the node to be deleted is equal to either the min or the max, we could use either the successor or the predecessor to update accordingly
