# constant successor and predecessor

goal: modify a balanced data structure so that search, insert, delete, mininum, and maximum still take up O(log n) while successor and predecessor take up O(1)

## solution

for each node, add two pointers for the successor and predecessor

modify insert and delete:

- insert - when traversing the tree when adding a new element, check whether or not the number is greater than or less than the value of the node being inserted and update the pointers
- delete - before removing the pointers to the node to be deleted, update the pointers that point to the current node as the successor or predecessor
