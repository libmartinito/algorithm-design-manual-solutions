# storage efficiency ratio

goal: find the storage efficiency ratio for the following:

- all nodes store data, two child pointers, and a parent pointer. data field requires 4 bytes, and each pointer requires 4 bytes
- only leaf nodes store data, internal nodes store two pointers. data field requires 4 bytes, and each pointer requires 2 bytes

## all nodes store data

for one parent node with two children:

total data space = 4 bytes x 3 nodes = 12 bytes
total pointer space = 4 bytes x 3 pointers x 3 nodes = 36 bytes
storage efficiency ratio = 12 bytes / (12 bytes + 36 bytes) = 1 / 4 = 25%

for three parent nodes:

total data space = 4 bytes x 7 nodes = 28 bytes
total pointer space = 4 bytes x 3 pointers x 7 nodes = 84 bytes
storage efficiency ratio = 28 bytes / (28 bytes + 84 bytes) = 1 / 4 = 25%

the answer is 25%

## only leaf nodes store data

for one parent node with two children:

total data space = 4 bytes x 2 nodes = 8 bytes
total pointer space = 2 bytes x 2 pointers x 3 node = 12 bytes
storage efficiency ratio = 8 bytes / (8 bytes + 12 bytes) = 2 / 5 = 40%

for three parent nodes:

total data space = 4 bytes x 4 nodes = 16 bytes
total pointer space = 2 bytes x 2 pointers x 7 nodes = 28 bytes
storage efficiency ratio = 16 bytes / (16 bytes + 28 bytes) = ~36%

for seven parent nodes:

total data space = 4 bytes x 8 nodes = 32 bytes
total pointer space = 2 bytes x 2 pointers x 15 nodes = 60 bytes
storage efficiency ratio = 32 bytes / (32 bytes + 60 bytes) = ~34%

the answer depends on the number of nodes
