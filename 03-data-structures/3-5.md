# amortized cost for deletions

so, the amortized cost for insertions is O(n).

i wrote about my understanding of the process [here](https://libhartha.com/dynamic-array-amortized-analysis/).

the goal is to better understand the amortized cost for deletions.

## underflow strategy

the underflow strategy proposed is to cut the array size in half when the array falls below half full.

we want to find an order of insertions and deletions where the amortized cost would be bad.

an obvious one is as follows:

array -> \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[ \]

deleting the last element causes the array to reduce in size:

array -> \[1\]\[2\]

adding the element would lead to a creation of a new array, copying elements over, and then adding the element:

array -> \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[ \]

doing this over and over would move the amortized cost towards O(n^2).

## better underflow strategy

one obvious improvement to the underflow strategy would be to wait longer before reducing the array size.

in our example above, we could wait until the elements reduces to 1/4th the array size before reducing the size.
