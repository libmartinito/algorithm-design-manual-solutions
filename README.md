# algorithm-design-manual-solutions

doing advent of code made me want to git gud at data structures and algorithms!

this is an attempt at solving most problems in steven skiena's popular textbook.

i want to do this in c++ (c doesn't have hash maps pls).

let's see how long this takes.

## running a solution

you can run the solution for a given day with the following script by passing in the number and the problem number.

```
./run-solution.sh 3 3-1
```
```
